- align exercise counts to right in tense-selector (tense names stay left-aligned)
- use localStorage to also remember which tenses are included
- add maximum width 500px for wide screens
- the progress card needs to span the whole width even above width=480px

- add more exercises, so every tense has at least 20 for now.
- improve the difficulty icon: use a simple intuitive icon 1/2/3 times instead of the current one
- lose the "Domina losâ€¦" line in the title bar
- add manifest to make this a web app
- make sure wrongly answered exercises come back several times for practice
